# Cultural-Data-Science-2020-digital-project

Hello there!
This is a digital project for Cultural Data Science class 2020 by Ruta Slivkaite and Jakub Raszka as part of Cognitive science bachelorÂ´s degree program at Aarhus University.
The project tries to demistify cognitive science job profile by webscraping the job aggregator 
graduateland.com and creating an interactive dashboard in Tableau Public for you to explore it!
Find the attached link to Tableau Public project presentation on this repository.
